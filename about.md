## Hello.

I’m Guilherme Almeida, designer currently based in Cologne, Germany. A seasoned professional with years of experience, I have specialized in doing UI and UX design for the video game industry.

I help studios improve game usability, enhance player immersion, and streamline workflows from concept to implementation. Whether you need a fresh UI design, a usability overhaul, or someone who understands both the creative and technical sides of game interfaces, I’m here to make that happen.

## Let's talk.
