**Cool STD Crisis** is the first game I ever made, done using the PICO-8 engine for an uni assignment back in 2016. It is Asteroids meets [Fantastic Voyage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO5E4wkg0hA){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} (old reference but I'm not THAT old), except instead of blasting drifting rocks in space, you're trying to eliminate viruses and bacteria from the blood flow. But you gotta use the right medicine on each of these tiny lifeforms, otherwise it will have no effect on them.

It ain't perfect for sure, and cheesing it is way too easy (I ain't telling how to do it), but everybody got to start somewhere. And, if you're wondering how I came up with this beauty of a title, the assignment stated all of us should start by using a random name generator, and then using the title as a starting point for the game design. This is not an excuse, by the way, I love it, but I wouldn't be able to come up with it by myself.
