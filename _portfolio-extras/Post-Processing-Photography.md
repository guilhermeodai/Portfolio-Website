A series of experiments with post-processing and LUT profiles, inspired by the works of [Masashi Wakui](https://www.flickr.com/photos/megane_wakui/with/51054535447){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. I aimed at replicating some of the aspects that drew me to his photography: ordinary scenes paired with surreal colors, especially on night time images.

Most of the pictures were taken a few years prior on a trip to Japan. Image quality was less than ideal, considering I took them with a phone and some disregard for proper lighting and framing techniques. In order to make them slightly less ordinary, I experimented with cropping (to highlight characters), adding depth of field, and even animating a few of them, besides the aforementioned LUT profiles to achieve unique colors.
