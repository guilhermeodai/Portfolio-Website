This project was conceived as an attempt to enhance fan engagement with South America's most prestigious football tournament, CONMEBOL Libertadores, through the development of a web-based fantasy game, where players create and manage virtual teams composed of real-life athletes, earning points from their performances in real-world matches. It also presented a great market opportunity, due to a combination of the massive popularity of football in South America and fantasy games being largely unexplored in the continent, though a few successful examples can be found, like Cartola FC in Brazil. In the end, however, the business case was not successful enough to allow the project to move forward, but the UI/UX process revealed the vast potential of such a platform in terms of promoting engagement.

The design process began with research into the habits and preferences of South American football fans. Personas were crafted to represent different audience segments, like die-hard supporters, casual viewers, as well as regional fan cultures. This was crucial to ensure the platform catered to newcomers, expected to make the majority of the audience at the beginning, while also tending to seasoned fantasy players from other leagues/sports.

Prototyping was an essential phase to explore different approaches to core interactions such as drafting players, setting up leagues, and viewing live score updates. Wireframes focused on navigation user flows, minimizing the learning curve for users unfamiliar with fantasy sports. Visual design largely leaned on the existing Libertadores design language, though the novel nature of the product meant not every component was covered by the tournament's branding guidelines and had to be designed from scratch, while trying to stay as faithful as possible to them.

User testing was conducted with a range of participants from Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Peru, with different levels of experience with fantasy games, and provided a number of issues to address in the next rounds of the iterative process. Onboarding proved to be a pain point to less experienced users, who found it a bit intimidating, so tutorials and tips were to be designed to guide them step-by-step. Testing also highlighted the importance of social features, leading to the inclusion of private leagues, and shareable leaderboards to encourage friendly competition and community building.

While the project didn't move forward due to concerns about its economic returns, the UI/UX process demonstrated how design could further drive fan engagement. Personally, the most valuable feedback from users, validating the potential we saw in fantasy games, was that over 70% of fans who normally only follow their team reported they would likely follow other matches to ensure their success in the game.
