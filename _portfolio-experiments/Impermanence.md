Impermanence was the result of my master thesis at TH KÃ¶ln where I explored player death as a game mechanic. Instead of just respawning the player from the last save point or file, how about if the player accumulated karma during gameplay and that karma was used to decide how players would look like when they revive, and what are their unique skills and/or weaknesses? While this was at its core a game design project, my previous background in visual and UI/UX design also played an important role in my approach to designing it.

From a visual design standpoint, the concepts of karma and samsara, the cyclical nature of life and death, dictated the iconography featured on menus and HUD elements: rounded shapes, fonts, and circles were used to represent it on a very abstract level, complemented with icons and symbols like ouroboros.

On the user experience front, a major goal was figuring out the impact of making information available or not to the player. The biggest example of this was the decision to hide the karma system almost completely from the UI. Cues were still provided on interactions with NPCs to explain how karma is a relevant concept in the game world, but no UI elements were added to the HUD to indicate the player's current karma status. The only exception to this being quest completion notifications, which mention whether karma changed for better or worse, but never in a quantified manner.

The idea here is that players would behave in a vastly different manner if such information was made available for them. A karma meter or status on screen would likely cause players to act more self-consciously when aware of the immediate impact of their actions, even if they don't fully know the inner workings of the karma system. It was admittedly an attempt to replicate the experience of a famous scene from Chrono Trigger, where players are subjected to a trial that looks back at their actions during the game's early moments, actions that until that point seemed to be fairly unremarkable and inconsequential.

To verify this theory, an A/B test was conducted to verify if players would be influenced or not by the presence of a karma UI element, and to what degree. The number of participants was too small to have statistical relevance (6), a limitation exacerbated due to this taking place back in the lockdown days of the 2020 pandemic, but it still offered interesting results. The main takeway was how it impacted player motivation, with those in the experimental group focusing on completing quests (a source of mostly positive karma, depending on dialogue choices and quest outcome), while the control group displayed varied motivations, like focusing on combat (often a source of negative karma) or map exploration.
