Impermanence was the result of my master thesis at TH Köln where I explored player death as a game mechanic. Instead of just respawning the player from the last save point or file, how about if the player accumulated karma during gameplay and that karma was used to decide how players would look like when they revive, and what are their unique skills and/or weaknesses? While this was at its core a game design project, my previous background in visual and UI/UX design also played an important role in my approach to designing it.

From a visual design standpoint, the concepts of karma and samsara, the cyclical nature of life and death, dictated the iconography featured on menus and HUD elements: rounded shapes, fonts, and circles were used to represent it on a very abstract level, complemented with icons and symbols like ouroboros.
