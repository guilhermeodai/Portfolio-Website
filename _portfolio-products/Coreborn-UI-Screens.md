Coreborn: Nations of the Ultracore is a multiplayer survival game developed by Blankhans GmbH. Set in the world of Tormentosia, the game blends crafting, exploration, and cooperative gameplay with a strong narrative foundation. Players build settlements, gather resources, and defend their communities against waves of enemy attacks, all while uncovering the deeper lore of the Core and its scattered nations.

As the UI/UX Designer for Coreborn, I was responsible for the design of the entire in-game interface — from visual aesthetics to user experience. This included screen layouts, interaction flows, menus, HUD elements, and overall visual polish. I collaborated closely with the game team to ensure the interface was not only visually cohesive but also intuitive and supportive of the gameplay experience.
