Website made for a campaign to end violence against the young population of Belo Horizonte, Brazil and its metro area. This platform was devised to engage and mobilize visitors, bringing attention to the scale of the issue and presenting a number of ways to support and spread the cause. One of the main strategies for this website was provoking an emotional response through interventions done by young people on their own photos, to symbolize several forms of violence they can be or were subject to. Visitors were invited to submit their own interventions, added to a wall of campaign supporters.

My role in this project was translating the campaign visual language created by a fellow designer to website form, which meant I was resposible for doing wireframes, layouts, HTML and CSS prototypes, before converting them to Wordpress/PHP. Additionally, I tested it across browsers, platforms and resolutions to ensure no issues would occur.
