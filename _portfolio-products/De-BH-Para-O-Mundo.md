Website created to promote an initative led by Invasões Bárbaras, a radio show from Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Its goal was to showcase local artists both to a domestic and international audience. 

Here I did the full website implementation: designing all layouts, producing a HTML/CSS prototype, then converting it into PHP/Wordpress and setting up the server. Given the intended audience, I also laid the groundwork to make the content available in multiple languages.
