Website made for a special project done by a radio show from Belo Horizonte, Brazil to showcase local artists. Intended to reach an international audience, all content was published not only in Portuguese, but also English, Spanish and French.

I was responsible for the full implementation of this website, meaning I designed all its layouts, produced a prototype in HTML/CSS, then converted it to a Wordpress theme in PHP. Furthermore, I conducted testing to ensure no issues would occur
across browsers, platforms or resolu-
tions.
