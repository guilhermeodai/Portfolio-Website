Website created to promote a project organized by Invasões Bárbaras, a radio show from Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Its goal was to showcase local artists both to a domestic and international audience, which required preparing the website to display content in multiple languages.

My role involved taking care of the full website implementation, meaning I designed all its layouts, produced a prototype in HTML/CSS, then converted it to a Wordpress theme in PHP. Furthermore, I conducted testing to ensure no issues would occur across browsers, platforms or resolutions.
