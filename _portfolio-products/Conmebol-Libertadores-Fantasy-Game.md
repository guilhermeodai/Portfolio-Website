This project was conceived as an attempt to enhance fan engagement with South America's most prestigious football tournament, CONMEBOL Libertadores, through the development of a web-based fantasy game, where players create and manage virtual teams composed of real-life athletes, earning points from their performances in real-world matches. 

It also presented a great market opportunity, due to a combination of the massive popularity of football in South America and fantasy games being largely unexplored in the continent, though a few successful examples can be found, like Cartola FC in Brazil. In the end, however, the business case was not successful enough to allow the project to move forward, but the UI/UX process revealed the vast potential of such a platform in terms of promoting engagement.
