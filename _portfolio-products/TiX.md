TiX is one of the most successful products of TiX Tecnologia Assistiva, an accessibility tech startup from Brazil. Designed to replace conventional keyboards and mice, the device offers an alternative input method for users with mobility impairments and other disabilities. 

The company was in the process of developing the production version of their homonimous flagship product when I was brought in to redesign its UI. They had a working prototype, and at the beginning their most pressing issue was of visual clarity: the prototype's UI was quite rough and cluttered, making it quite information dense and hard to read.

The starting point then was reworking the design of the pads. TiX features 11 touch-sensitive pads the user activates through combinations of consecutive touches. Nine of these pads are used for character input, while the remaining two serve as modifiers to enable or disable specific functions. Each pad is distinguished by both a color and a unique symbol. This dual coding system not only reinforces recognition and memorability but also ensures that users with visual impairments such as color blindness can rely on shape recognition to navigate the interface effectively.

Because the device is often used by individuals who may not be able to operate it with their hands, it was also important to optimize the interface for use with the feet. This meant increasing the size and contrast of text and icons to ensure they remained legible from a greater distance than one would expect from a conventional keyboard or mouse.

Over the course of approximately two months, the product went through several iterations. One change incorporated into the second revision was repositioning the pads, aligning those in the middle row with the gaps of upper and lower rows, making all pads equidistant and minimizing the chance of accidental presses.

The most significant change though came before the third and final revision, when mouse functionality was introduced. This expanded the device's scope considerably and required the integration of a new set of visual elements to clearly communicate mouse-specific functions. Considering visual clarity was an issue from the very beginning, integrating this was certainly tricky, even more so on a number of pads featuring more than one function (double click and scrolling down, for example)
